This is a patch to the Independent JPEG Group's image compression library version 8c (16-Jan-2011). http://www.ijg.org/
It improves the drop transform's functionality in cases where the dropped image's right or bottom edge lies exactly on the other image's right/bottom border.
Previously the non-MCU-size blocks on the right/bottom image edge would not have been copied at all. Now they are.
This patch includes the "droppatch" (which adds the drop functionality and allows extending the image by cropping outside the image borders) from http://jpegclub.org/jpegtran/.
Actual modifications have only been made to "transupp.c".
